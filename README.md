# Grid Convergence Index (GCI)

This code applies the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) method to quantify the grid error for Computational Fluid Dynamics applications.

The code asks the user the following:

1. The dimensions of the problem, i.e., a 2D or 3D grid.
2. The grid's number of cells.
3. The CFD solution for the coarse, medium and fine grids.

* Note: this code is the first coding iteration, meaning it can be improved.
