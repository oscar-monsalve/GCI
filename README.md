# Grid Convergence Index (GCI)

This code applies the Grid Convergence Index (GCI) method to quantify the grid error for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications.

The program asks the user the following:

1. The dimensions of the problem/grid, i.e., 2D or 3D.
2. The grid's number of cells for the fine, medium and coarse grids.
3. The CFD solution for the fine, medium and coarse grids.

Note: this code is at its first implementation iteration, meaning it can be improved.
